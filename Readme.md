## Configuration

The plugin has a very simple `config.yml` to configure the database connection and some defaults. The primary configuration takes place inside the `achievements/` folder where all of the achievements are configured.

```yaml
# the path to the achievements configs
# all configs in here are loaded recursively
achievements: achievements/
# the default achievement type to use if none is specified in the config
# see below for a list of inbuilt types
default_type: none
database:
  username: sa
  password: sa
  driver: h2
  url: "jdbc:h2:~/achievements.db"
```

## Achievement Configuration

Achievements can exist as configuration files or in the database only. It depends on how you created them. You can always save a database achievement to disk by running the `/rca:admin save <achievement>` command.

Create new achievement configs inside the `achievements` directory as `.yml` files. All achievements can have the following properties but require none of them by default.

> All configured achievements are stored in the database, regardless if they are loaded from configs or created with commands.  
> Just command created achievements do not exist as configs, automatically. They need to be saved: `/rca:admin save <achievement>`.

```yaml
# DO NOT CHANGE OR REMOVE THIS
# the id is automatically generated the first time your achievement is loaded.
# do not modify or remove it or else all players will lose this achievement.
# if you copy a config make sure to remove the id from the copy.
# id: de3d61fb-6c7c-4ca3-816b-7b7c8175522b

# a short and precise unique alias of the achievement used in commands.
# if no specified the alias is equal to the file name.
alias: my-first-achievement
# the type of the achievement defines how the achievement is processed and how the player can unlock it.
# the default type "none" can only be given manually to the player /rca:admin add <player> <achievement>
type: none
# a friendly name of the achievement that is displayed to the player

# set to false to disable the achievement
# player that unlocked it will keep the achievement but no new player can unlock it
enabled: true
# hidden achievements are only displayed once unlocked
hidden: false
# secret achievements have their name displayed but only players that unlocked it can read the description
secret: false
# set to false to disable broadcasting this achievement when a player unlocks it
broadcast: true
# set to true to require the rcachievements.achievement.<alias> permission to unlock the achievement
restricted: false
# the with section contains all config values required by the achievement type
# see the list below for built in achievement types and their config values

```
